//! The daemon worker's autonomous continuation loop — the in-run drive
//! (the #254 ambiguity, resolved against the TS binary).
//!
//! TS ruling (probed against the installed TS daemon over the shared
//! faux-provider harness): the autonomous continuation rides the agent
//! loop's natural-turn-end hook (`getContinuationMessages` -> the
//! autonomous arm of `_getContinuationMessages`), so the continuation
//! churns INSIDE the one prompt wait — `turn_end -> turn_start` with the
//! continuation user row's message pair between them, no run boundary
//! between continuation turns, one `agent_end` per prompt wait. What ends
//! the loop: the driver's stop decisions (a passing gate, an exhausted
//! limit), `/autonomous off`, or an error/abort turn — the stop never
//! writes a row or a stream frame (the headless status request and the
//! print exit contract carry it).
//!
//! The Rust mapping: the in-run hook (installed at session build) is the
//! natural mint. The gates mirror TS `_getContinuationMessages` and
//! `_shouldStopForThresholdCompaction`: queued session input defers, an
//! active goal owns the boundary (the goal arm's exclusive priority), a
//! pending requested compaction consumes the stop, unsettled RLM
//! descendant work holds the continuation (the settle hook delivers the
//! owed turn), a live background bash handle holds it the same way (TS
//! #2465: the kernel's background-work settlement is the wake-up), and a
//! threshold compaction due mints the continuation
//! ahead of the loop stop and holds it — the turn loop's settled boundary
//! runs the compaction and hands the held turn to the worker's queue
//! lanes (TS `_queueAutonomousContinuationForThresholdCompaction`'s queued
//! `followUp` admission).
