//! The stop/delete lifecycle cleanup (the zombie-resurrection fix):
//! stopping or deleting a session must cancel its scheduled jobs so no
//! schedule fire, wake pass, or goal continuation can revive it.
//!
//! The TS surfaces this ports (daemon-supervisor.ts + daemon-mode.ts):
//!
//! - `finalizeArchivedWorkerStop` — the root-kill stop's durable half:
//!   the supervisor cancels the session tree's scheduled jobs (the
//!   belt behind the worker's own close-time cancel) and marks the
//!   session file `archived` (the catalog `archive` belt when the
//!   worker died before its own close wrote the state).
//! - `cancelScheduledJobsForSessionTree` — the tree walk a cancel
//!   covers: children-by-parent from the spawn ledger, a live worker
//!   covering any tree member owns its stores again (the cancel must
//!   not kill new schedules), partitions register only when their
//!   `scheduled-jobs.json` exists.
//! - `cancelEphemeralWorkerScheduledJobs` — a client-owned (ephemeral)
//!   worker's schedules die with the registration.
//! - `wakeDueScheduledSessions` / `collectPassiveScheduledJobs` — the
//!   TS wake scan only wakes jobs whose session file still exists, is
//!   still `active`, and whose tree no live worker covers: a killed
//!   session (state `archived`) or a deleted file is never revived.
//!   (The Rust port no longer wakes at all — the takeover field fix's
//!   no-auto-resume contract: a schedule fires only while its session
//!   is live, and the boot reports due jobs on not-running sessions as
//!   dormant instead of creating workers for them.)
//! - `deleteRlmSubagentArtifacts` — a deleted RLM subagent's artifact
//!   partition goes with the tombstone (best-effort, never fails the
//!   deletion).
