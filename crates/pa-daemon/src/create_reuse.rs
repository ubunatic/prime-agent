//! The create-open reuse seam (TS `createOrReuseWorker`'s reuse half): a
//! create that targets a session file a live worker already serves answers
//! THE LIVE WORKER instead of launching a second process over the same
//! file. The second launch is not a duplicate — it is a guaranteed failure:
//! the runtime session lease the live worker holds makes the new worker's
//! create bounce with `Session is already active`, which the client saw as
//! a bare rejection of its open request. TS never launches over a live
//! file (`matchWorkers`/`findWorkerBySessionFile` -> `reuseWorkerForCreate`
//! -> the create arm answers the live worker's root summary; the client
//! attaches, the roster's clients column gains a row).
//!
//! The seam classifies every resident registered for the file:
//! - **route-ready** (connected, create completed): reused immediately.
//! - **waitable** (a replacement mid-replay or crash backoff): the open
//!   waits out the replacement inside the create's own route budget, like
//!   every client-facing route, then reuses; a worker that never returns
//!   (retired, give-up) falls through to a fresh launch, and a fresh
//!   launch over a dead process's file reclaims its lease by construction.
//! - **stopping/retired**: the launch must wait out the teardown — the
//!   dying process still holds the lease — then launch; a stop that
//!   outlives the settle budget answers the TS `worker is stopping` shape
//!   instead of surfacing the lease rejection.
//!
//! A stale binding (the file's previous worker is gone) keeps the launch
//! path: `record_session_binding` supersedes the old ids at create success
//! and the `session_binding` events re-attach the superseded clients
//! (the #2575 rebind seams; unchanged here).
