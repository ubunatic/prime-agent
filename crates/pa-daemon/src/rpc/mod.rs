//! RPC stdio mode: headless operation with JSON commands on stdin and
//! JSON responses and events on stdout (TS `modes/rpc/rpc-mode.ts`).
//!
//! One connection drives one live session. Commands arrive as JSON lines
//! and answer one ordered stream of response and event frames: the
//! response `data` channel distinguishes an absent key from JSON `null`,
//! a `prompt` response is written before the turn's stream events
//! (events landing while the response is pending are buffered and
//! flushed after it, TS `promptResponsePending`), prompts serialize on
//! a stdin-order chain (TS `promptCommandTail`) while other commands
//! run concurrently, and stdin close settles the running turn before
//! the process exits. SIGTERM exits 143 and SIGHUP 129 (TS signal exit
//! codes).
//!
//! The in-process transport serves the session engine directly, exactly
//! like the TS in-process connection: the scheduling and agent-messaging
//! surfaces answer their TS in-process "requires daemon mode" errors,
//! and `observe` sees no other active sessions (the in-process session
//! hosts no family) — the daemon-attached transport serves those for
//! real.
