//! The supervisor's OS-signal drain loop (SIGTERM/SIGINT): the Codex
//! app-server's `shutdown_signal` + `ShutdownState` structure
//! (codex-rs/app-server/src/lib.rs) adapted to the multi-worker supervisor.
//!
//! [`Supervisor::begin_signal_drain`] is the state machine: the first
//! signal enters the graceful drain (new work refused at the gates, every
//! client told the daemon is closing, the running turns settled by each
//! worker's routed `shutdown` flush barrier, the workers retired so
//! nothing lingers in the supervisor-lost window); a later signal - or one
//! that finds a client-command shutdown, a committed update stop, or an
//! update exit already in flight - is the force request, and the forced
//! exit skips teardown entirely: runtime teardown can wait forever on
//! blocked worker I/O (the Codex `AppServerExit::Forced` rationale,
//! app-server/src/main.rs).
//!
//! [`install`] registers the handlers synchronously (the run loop calls it
//! directly after the socket binds, before its next await) and returns the
//! loop that serves them: a signal cannot land in a spawn-to-first-poll
//! window with the default disposition still active. A handler that fails
//! to register is logged and dropped while the other signal keeps
//! draining; dropping a registered listener would strand its signal
//! (tokio keeps the replacement disposition installed after the listener
//! is gone, so a dropped stream swallows every later delivery).
