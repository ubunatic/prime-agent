//! The supervisor's compaction-abort supervision: the abort token for
//! workers that cannot answer their own abort command.
//!
//! The worker's abort slot ([`crate::compaction::CompactionManager::abort`])
//! and the engine's `auto_compaction_abort` answer an `abort_compaction`
//! only while the worker's command plane is alive. When a worker wedges
//! mid-compaction — the runtime running the summarizer stops answering —
//! the routed abort rides the same dead channel and dies on the 30s route
//! timeout, leaving every attached loader hung with no `compaction_end`
//! ever.
//!
//! This module lifts the abort to the supervisor plane. The token arms on
//! the `compaction_start` frame the supervisor already forwards and clears
//! on the matching end; the supervisor's `abort_compaction` arm acknowledges
//! immediately without a worker round-trip (the TS daemon-mode
//! `abortCompaction` is in-process and always instant — the worker split
//! must not regress that) and still forwards best-effort so a healthy
//! worker aborts its own run. When no end lands within the grace window,
//! the supervisor declares the run terminal: the durable record goes to
//! its own journal (the terminal state survives supervisor restarts and
//! feeds the replacement-worker create replay), and the synthetic
//! `compaction_end` broadcast clears every attached loader.
