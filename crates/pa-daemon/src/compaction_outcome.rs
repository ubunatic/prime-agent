//! The unsuccessful-compaction disclosure (TS `_endCompactionUnsuccessfully`
//! -> `_persistCompactionOutcome`): when an automatic compaction at a turn
//! boundary skips or fails, the daemon records the durable
//! `compaction_outcome` custom row (the session seam), broadcasts it as a
//! `message_start`/`message_end` pair, and emits the settled `compaction_end`
//! event carrying the same message. Manual `/compact` stays excluded (TS
//! `compact()` reports its outcome on the event only and throws to the
//! caller).
