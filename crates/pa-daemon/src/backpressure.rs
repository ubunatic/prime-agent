//! Bounded backpressure on the supervisor's request path (the Codex
//! `app-server-transport` mirror, comparison report finding 4).
//!
//! Codex fronts its one `app-server` process with a bounded internal queue
//! (`CHANNEL_CAPACITY = 128`, `app-server-transport/src/transport/mod.rs:21-24`)
//! and answers a request that finds it full with an explicit typed error
//! (`-32001 "Server overloaded; retry later."`, `mod.rs:228-259`) instead of
//! blocking or dropping; non-request traffic awaits (`mod.rs:265`), and each
//! connection drains a deep bounded outbound queue (32K messages with a
//! compile-time headroom assert, `websocket.rs:46-49`).
//!
//! This daemon fronts N per-session worker processes, so the same guarantees
//! adapt per unit: [`WORKER_INFLIGHT_CAPACITY`] bounds the in-flight
//! requests of one worker (128, like Codex's single-process bound — the
//! supervisor's aggregate bound is `128 * N`, and a flooding client
//! exhausts only the session it floods), and
//! [`CLIENT_OUTBOUND_CAPACITY`] bounds one client connection's outbound
//! queue (the 32K mirror). A request-shaped client command that finds its
//! worker saturated is answered with the typed [`DaemonErrorInfo`]
//! `worker_overloaded` refusal (the `-32001` analog): the request never
//! entered the queue, so nothing is dropped silently and a retry cannot
//! duplicate it. Supervisor-internal routes (stop/kill, create replay,
//! disconnect cleanup, polls) are never refused — they wait for a slot
//! inside the route's own timeout budget, the same backpressure split
//! Codex makes between requests and notifications.
