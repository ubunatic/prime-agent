//! The boot-revival ownership gate: whether a dead worker's descriptor
//! may be relaunched at a supervisor boot. #2584's busy-evidence filter
//! answered "did the journal prove live work?"; this gate answers "is that
//! proof still a genuine interruption THIS boot must heal?" — a stopped
//! or already-condemned session must never come back as an active worker
//! through the daemon's own automatic paths (the zombie-resurrection
//! fix): a client reopen is the only legitimate way back.
//!
//! Four vetoes, in check order:
//!
//! 1. The give-up verdict. A descriptor the supervisor marked `failed`
//!    (the 6-consecutive-failure cap) carries durable intent: this
//!    supervisor already tried and gave up on reviving it. A later boot
//!    re-runs that verdict, never the relaunch — otherwise every boot
//!    re-storms the same dead slots (the 12:00→17:07 recurrence on the
//!    rust-agent box).
//! 2. The stop lifecycle's archived belt (#2592). A session whose durable
//!    state is `archived` was stopped on purpose; the belt is the stop's
//!    durable half. No automatic path may flip it back to `active` —
//!    revival would erase the stop and re-register a dead session as a
//!    live worker.
//! 3. A live session lease. The runtime lease is the one ownership record
//!    every daemon sharing the agent dir can read; a live holder (this
//!    daemon's own surviving process, or another daemon's worker — the
//!    two-daemons-one-store fleet) owns the session file. Spawning a
//!    rival worker over it would either fail on the lease (the 6-strike
//!    storm) or, without leases enabled, double-serve the file.
//! 4. Stale busy evidence. A `busy` recovery record is interrupted-work
//!    proof only while it is recent: the crash window is minutes, not
//!    hours. A record older than
//!    [`REVIVAL_BUSY_EVIDENCE_MAX_AGE_MS`] is residue of an era that
//!    already ended, and a timestamp dated beyond
//!    [`REVIVAL_CLOCK_SKEW_MS`] into the future is not freshness proof
//!    either (clock rollback must not zero the age) — uncertainty
//!    never revives. The stale evidence that caused the boot storms was
//!    five-hour-old journals (a prior crash/restore whose workers went
//!    on to die or be stopped). Update-kept roster rows are exempt: the
//!    roster is this update's own point-in-time intent, so its busy
//!    journals are not the evidence being trusted.
