//! The daemon-boot predecessor reap (operator-directed product behavior,
//! a sanctioned divergence from TS documented per the #289 precedent).
//!
//! A session worker outlives its supervisor by design (the TS daemon spawns
//! it detached; [`crate::supervisor_lost`] garbage-collects it only after a
//! five-minute unreachable-supervisor window). That window never fires for
//! a worker whose supervisor died while a NEW daemon took over the same
//! socket path: the worker's availability probe connects to the new
//! daemon and resets the absence timer, so a leftover worker holds its
//! runtime session lease forever - every open of its session bounces with
//! `Session is already active in <leftover id>`, and nothing on the new
//! daemon can reach it: its registration is refused (its descriptor was
//! deleted at the predecessor's terminal stop, or never written), the
//! adoption pass cannot adopt it (no descriptor), and the create-open
//! reuse seam cannot reuse it (no resident).
//!
//! The operator's semantics: a daemon that boots on a socket owns that
//! socket's lineage - same-socket predecessor leftovers die at boot, so
//! their leases clear and opening a session post-restart works. Daemons -
//! and workers - on DIFFERENT sockets are never touched (the two-daemons-
//! one-store fleet; the mission-box containment rule): the scan matches
//! the predecessor identity by the socket path alone.
//!
//! What the reap takes, exactly:
//! - Worker processes (`worker` as the first argument of a product binary -
//!   the argv the supervisor spawns) whose `PRIME_AGENT_INTERNAL_DAEMON_SUPERVISOR_SOCKET`
//!   names THIS daemon's socket, minus the pids this daemon's own
//!   descriptors name (those are the adoption pass's business: a crash
//!   restart's live workers re-register and keep serving - the
//!   must-not-lose-sessions invariant). The argv gate is load-bearing:
//!   the supervisor-socket env var propagates to every process a session
//!   worker spawns (kernels, bash children, tool servers), and an env-only
//!   match would kill a session's whole process tree at the next daemon
//!   boot - the `readoption_wake` regression this gate exists for. The
//!   target's own endpoint path gates only the cleanup unlink (a
//!   validated deterministic name); the kill never depends on the
//!   endpoint file.
//! - Supervisor processes of THIS socket path that are not this process:
//!   a wedged predecessor (alive but unreachable - its socket was probed
//!   stale and replaced) would otherwise keep its orphaned listener and
//!   its workers' supervisor connections forever.
//!
//! The escalation is the CLI stop contract (`stop_tracked_process`):
//! SIGTERM, a bounded grace, SIGKILL, a bounded verify - identity-gated by
//! the process start id so a recycled pid is never signaled. Processes the
//! platform cannot enumerate (non-Linux, no /proc) are not reaped here; the
//! worker-side refused-registration self-heal covers those platforms.
