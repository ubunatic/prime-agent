//! Session registry: the supervisor's roster of resident session workers,
//! their durable identities, and worker self-registration records.
//!
//! The registry is the supervisor's core state under the thin-supervisor
//! architecture: which sessions exist, where each worker's socket is, and
//! how clients select them. Process supervision (spawn/restart/health) and
//! client command routing live in `supervisor.rs`; later migration stages
//! move routing out while the registry stays.
//!
//! Two paths build registry entries: the supervisor's own launch/adoption
//! flows, and session-worker self-registration
//! (`DaemonCommand::WorkerRegister`) - the path that rebuilds the roster
//! after a supervisor restart. A per-worker adoption gate serializes the two
//! so a worker is never adopted twice concurrently.
