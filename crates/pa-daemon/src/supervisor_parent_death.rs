//! Supervisor-side parent-death cleanup for RLM children: the seam that
//! closes a hard-killed parent worker's resident children (the #246
//! adjacent gap).
//!
//! TS ground truth (`modes/daemon/daemon-mode.ts`): RLM children are hosted
//! in the parent's process, so they die with it - any death of the parent,
//! including SIGKILL, takes its children down, and the durable spawn ledger
//! keeps their roster rows as passive family rows. The Rust redesign hosts
//! each child as its own supervisor-owned worker process, and the #246
//! close runs inside the parent worker (the replacement/kill/shutdown
//! teardowns), so a SIGKILL bypasses every close path and the children
//! would survive their parent as orphaned workers. The supervisor's
//! worker-death monitoring is the only component that observes the death,
//! so the close ports there: on an unexpected exit, every resident worker
//! whose durable create names the dead worker as its parent (the runtime
//! metadata's `parentActiveSessionId`, the same join TS
//! `getChildActiveSessionStates` runs) stops with its parent - the same
//! wire action the #246 `SupervisorChildSessions::close_children` issues
//! per child (a `kill` with no `rlmLedgerDelete` marker: a plain stop, so
//! the spawn edge and the passive roster row survive, and the child
//! worker's own kill handler closes the child's children first - the
//! grandchild cascade is the kill route's recursion, TS
//! `closeSessionOnce`'s cascade).
