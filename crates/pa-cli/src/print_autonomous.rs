//! The print run's autonomous continuation loop — the in-run drive (the
//! #254 ambiguity, resolved against the TS binary).
//!
//! TS ruling (probed over the shared faux-provider harness,
//! `prime-agent --mode json`): the autonomous continuation rides the agent
//! loop's natural-turn-end hook (`getContinuationMessages` -> the
//! autonomous arm of `_getContinuationMessages`), so the continuation
//! churns INSIDE the one prompt wait — `turn_end -> turn_start` with the
//! continuation user row's message pair between them, no
//! `agent_start`/`agent_end` between continuation turns, one
//! `agent_end` per prompt wait. What ends the loop: the driver's stop
//! decisions (a passing gate, an exhausted limit) or `/autonomous off` —
//! the stop never writes a row or a stream frame (the headless exit
//! contract reports it); a threshold compaction due at the settled turn
//! queues the continuation as a `followUp` admission (TS
//! `_queueAutonomousContinuationForThresholdCompaction`: the mint bumps
//! the budget ahead of the loop stop, the boundary compacts, the queued
//! turn runs post-compaction).
//!
//! The Rust mapping: the composed hook installed here runs the goal arm
//! first (TS gives the goal exclusive priority) and the autonomous arm on
//! the fall-through; the driver's held continuation drains through the
//! print boundary pair (the queued `followUp` shape). Text mode runs the
//! same loop silently; the process exit contract stays the headless one.
