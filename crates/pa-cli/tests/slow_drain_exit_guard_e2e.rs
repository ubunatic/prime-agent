//! Real-pty e2e for the slow-drain exit-guard contract: the exit flush
//! streams the whole transcript into native scrollback, and on a terminal
//! that consumes it slowly (a laggy ssh, a parsing tap) the drain outlasts
//! the 1500ms force-quit deadline that arms at the second Ctrl+C. The
//! contract under test has two sides:
//!
//! 1. A DRAINING terminal is not a stalled shutdown: the flush writer
//!    reports progress per completed chunk (view.rs `FlushSink`), the
//!    release tail and the resume hint report theirs, and the watchdog
//!    holds its fire while progress lands — the flush completes
//!    byte-identically (the frozen scrollback contract), the restore
//!    tail lands after the last flushed row, and `shutdown stalled`
//!    never prints (TS semantics: TS has no watchdog at all and simply
//!    waits for its writes).
//! 2. A genuinely stalled drain still fires: a terminal that stops
//!    consuming mid-flush produces no progress for the whole grace
//!    window, and the watchdog force-quits with the same message and
//!    exit code as ever.
//!
//! The harness drives the REAL chat surface over a pty (the child is
//! this binary re-executed against a mock supervisor socket, the
//! kitty-release e2e's pattern) and paces its own reads of the pty
//! master — the terminal's drain rate is the test's knob.
