//! The terminal-state differential: a recording mock terminal over a
//! real pty asserts that EVERY terminal mode the TUI arms comes back
//! off on EVERY exit route.
//!
//! The operator's directive (2026-09-28, the kitty-exit-leak sweep):
//! "if the kitty protocol is leaking to my shell, check if OTHER things
//! are leaking too." The confirmed kitty leak has its own lane; this
//! harness is the systematic net for everything else. The mock terminal
//! (the harness itself, over the pty master) records every
//! mode-affecting byte the child writes, answers the kitty capability
//! query like a kitty terminal would, drives one exit route, and then
//! asserts THE MODE DELTA IS EMPTY: the terminal state the child hands
//! back equals the state it received. A leak — any mode left armed,
//! any kitty flag pushed and not popped, an SGR left dangling, a
//! termios bit left raw — fails the route.
//!
//! The tracked state, per the inventory (handoffs/TERMINAL-LEAK-AUDIT.md):
//! - DEC private modes (`ESC[?NNNh/l`): bracketed paste 2004, mouse
//!   1000/1002/1003/1006, cursor visibility 25, alt screen 47/1047/1049,
//!   synchronized output 2026, wrap 7, focus reporting 1004, flow control
//!   33 — every mode number the stream writes, known or not: an unknown
//!   mode behaves exactly like a known one (set without reset = leak);
//! - the kitty keyboard protocol: `>Nu` pushes, `<u` pops, `=Nu` sets
//!   (the flags stack depth), plus `>4;Nm` modifyOtherKeys;
//! - SGR: the attribute state at exit must be empty (a dangling color
//!   would paint the shell's own output after the exit);
//! - OSC 8 hyperlinks: every open closed (a dangling open makes the
//!   shell's output a live link); one-shot OSC 52 clipboard writes and
//!   OSC 133 shell-integration markers are counted, not owed;
//! - writes the product does not own today — DECKPAM/DECKPNM
//!   (`ESC=`/`ESC>`), DECSCUSR cursor shapes, margin sets, OSC 0/2 title
//!   sets — any appearance is a finding, so the net catches a future
//!   surface arming one without its restore;
//! - the pty's termios (raw mode lives there, not in the byte stream):
//!   the whole flag set and control characters must return equal.
//!
//! The exit routes parameterize the table (the kitty-exit-leak lane's
//! enumeration): the parity exit (`/exit` and the Ctrl+C pair), the
//! detach handoff to the agents view, the agents-view returns (a fresh
//! entry and the roster-failure error route behind a preserved
//! handoff), the picker exits (the config selector's close, its
//! remapped exit, and the toggle error), the force-quit watchdog from a
//! wedged loop, the panic unwind (the replay surface's panic driver),
//! the error returns, the suspend cycle's mid-run release (the shell
//! gets the terminal while the process is stopped), and the pre-mount
//! daemon refusal (which must restore NOTHING — nothing was armed).
