//! Process-group suspend/resume (TS `handleCtrlZ` and its `SIGCONT`
//! resume handler).
//!
//! The `app.suspend` action (default ctrl+z) hands the terminal to the
//! shell: SIGINT is ignored for the suspended window, the TUI stops (SGR
//! mouse tracking off, alternate screen left and flushed into native
//! scrollback, raw mode off), and the whole process group is stopped with
//! SIGTSTP. Execution continues where the signal stopped it once the user
//! foregrounds the process again (SIGCONT), and the resume re-applies
//! every terminal mode a suspend cycle can lose: raw mode, the alternate
//! screen, and SGR mouse tracking (TS `ui.start()` + `applyFullscreen(true)`
//! inside the one-shot `SIGCONT` handler).
//!
//! The signal and terminal operations sit behind two small traits so the
//! cycle's sequencing — the part that is easy to get wrong — is verified
//! by unit tests without stopping the test process.
