//! Browser launch for clicked hyperlinks (TS `tui.ts` `openHyperlink`'s
//! platform table — darwin `open`, Windows `rundll32
//! url.dll,FileProtocolHandler`, otherwise `xdg-open`).
//!
//! Terminals gate their native link handling while mouse reporting is
//! active (Ghostty only refreshes link hover when reporting is off or
//! shift is held), so clicks the TUI consumes must open their OSC 8
//! targets themselves. pa-tui stays pa-types-only: this is the TUI
//! package's own opener (the composition root's login flows carry theirs
//! in pa-core), exactly like TS where tui.ts and the login dialog each
//! build the same command table.
//!
//! The opener always resolves to an absolute path: `Command::new` would
//! search the inherited `PATH` for a bare name, where a doctored
//! environment could redirect a click into an arbitrary program, so the
//! platform tables pin the system tool locations instead (macOS's `open`
//! is fixed, the xdg-utils slots cover the mainstream Linux layouts, and
//! a tool that is not there is a failed launch — never a `PATH` hunt).
//! Windows's `rundll32.exe` runs as the program itself with the protocol
//! handler and the URL as its arguments: passing the executable's own
//! path as an argument would have `rundll32` load it as a DLL.
