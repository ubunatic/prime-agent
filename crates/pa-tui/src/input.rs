//! One crossterm input reader per process at a time.
//!
//! TUI surfaces hand the terminal to each other inside one process: the
//! agents-view loop opens chat sessions and reopens the view, and `/resume`
//! chains open one session after another. crossterm events are process
//! global, so two concurrent reader threads race for the same bytes; the
//! losing (older) thread can read a keypress after its channel is gone and
//! drop it — the user's key vanishes. The reader joins the still-running
//! reader from the previous surface before starting the next one, so
//! exactly one reader is alive at any time.
//!
//! [`spawn_paste_aware_reader`] runs the TS `StdinBuffer` raw-paste
//! heuristic for the editor-bearing surfaces (the session surface and the
//! agents view's composers): a keystroke burst that arrives in one chunk
//! shaped like multi-line text (text, newline, text — tmux 3.2 and older
//! forward pastes without bracketed markers) is coalesced into one paste
//! instead of submitting line by line. A zero-timeout poll after each
//! read marks the chunk boundary: crossterm serves the rest of the same
//! OS read without blocking, so a burst is exactly the events one
//! terminal write carried.
//!
//! Both readers also run the [`SequenceGuard`] (TS `StdinBuffer`'s
//! partial-sequence hold, ported in [`crate::sequence_guard`]):
//! crossterm's parser commits a lone trailing `ESC` at every partial-read
//! boundary, and the sequence it opened then arrives as plain `Char`
//! presses — a mouse drag types SGR report bodies into the editor. The
//! guard holds that `ESC`, reassembles the sequence, and hands the reader
//! decoded mouse reports and consumed escape forms instead.
//!
//! Every chunk then flows through the TS enhanced-key dispatch filters
//! (see [`filter_enhanced_key_events`]): key releases are dropped (TS
//! tui.ts dispatch filter) and a duplicate-reporting kitty terminal's
//! raw-text twin of a plain CSI-u character is deduplicated (TS
//! `StdinBuffer` `pendingKittyPrintableCodepoint`, stdin-buffer.ts:307).
