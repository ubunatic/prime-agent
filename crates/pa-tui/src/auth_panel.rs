//! The inline auth panel (TS `LoginDialogComponent` +
//! `PrimeTeamSelectorComponent`, the surfaces `host.showAuthPanel`
//! mounts): the ONE TUI surface the interactive login flows render
//! through. A flow runs in the background and drives the panel through
//! [`AuthPanelHandle`] — progress lines, the browser URL block, a paste
//! prompt, or the Prime team picker — while the TUI run loop folds each
//! request into the mounted panel and answers the prompt/picker requests
//! from the keyboard. No login path ever takes over the plain terminal
//! (the TS auth flows never drop out of the TUI either): no
//! alternate-screen leave, no screen clear, no raw-stdin prompt.
//!
//! The request/reply channel follows the run loop's background-note
//! pattern: the flow's task owns the handle (a plain sender), the loop
//! owns the receiving side, and every prompt carries its own oneshot
//! reply. A flow completion is a request too (the `Settled` variants):
//! the loop unmounts the panel and applies the outcome row.
//!
//! TS carries an abort signal on its login dialog (Esc cancels a running
//! check). The cooperative mirror (#2770): every handle shares one
//! cancel flag — the driving surface marks it when the panel exits and
//! a running flow checks it between its poll steps and before its
//! credential writes (a `JoinHandle::abort` cannot reach a started
//! blocking login body, so the flag is the seam). The paste prompt and
//! the team picker answer their own cancels; the network steps settle
//! within their request timeouts; a settled flow always unmounts the
//! panel.
