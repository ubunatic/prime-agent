//! The agents-view subagent forest: how unified records nest into the
//! session list's rows. One pass computes the record hierarchy (parent
//! linkage, rollups), then row building emits top-level agents with their
//! subagent summary line and, when the line is expanded, its nested
//! children. Selection resolution and ancestry walks over that row tree
//! live here too. Pure functions on the wire forms (roster summaries and
//! saved-catalog rows); the view module owns input and painting.
//!
//! Operator directive (2026-09-28): a parent with descendants carries ONE
//! summary line — `"{total} subagents ({running} running)"` — that
//! expands to the FULL roster in one group, the running rows first (with
//! their running state), the inactive after, every child rendering in
//! place with its own nested line. TS parity: TS
//! `createSubagentSummaryRow` titles one `"{n} subagents running"` /
//! `"{n} subagents"` line that expands to every child — the same
//! one-line shape, with the operator's both-counts label as a
//! sanctioned divergence.
