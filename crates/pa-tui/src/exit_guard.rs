//! Force-quit guard for the double-Ctrl+C exit contract.
//!
//! The interactive loop is not always alive when the user wants out: a
//! daemon request on the key-handling path can hold the loop for seconds
//! (`UI_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS`), the exit path itself awaits several bounded
//! requests, and a wedged runtime never runs those bounds at all. Issue
//! #138's per-request caps bound the healthy path, but the second Ctrl+C
//! still has to be *observed by the loop* before they apply, so the exit
//! could lag indefinitely — the live report: the first press is accepted
//! (abort sent), the second never terminates.
//!
//! The contract this module enforces: two Ctrl+C presses inside the exit
//! window mean exit, and the process is gone within
//! [`FORCE_QUIT_AFTER_MS`] of the second press — no matter what the loop,
//! the daemon connection, or the async runtime is doing. The observation
//! runs on the terminal reader thread (the one component that stays alive
//! when the UI loop is wedged) and the enforcement runs on a plain
//! `std::thread` watchdog that needs no runtime, so even a deadlocked
//! runtime cannot stop it.
//!
//! Semantics stay TS-exact while the loop is healthy: the reader arms the
//! watchdog for any in-window Ctrl+C *pair*, and the loop disarms it once
//! it has handled every observed Ctrl+C press without exiting (first press
//! closed an autocomplete or aborted the turn, TS `handleCtrlC`). Counted
//! handoff is what makes both directions sound: a handled press can never
//! clear the deadline of a press still queued behind it, so a pair that
//! the wedged loop never reaches always fires, and a pair a healthy loop
//! consumed always disarms.
