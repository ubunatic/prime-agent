//! Daemon incident notices for the agents view (TS
//! `src/modes/agents-view/incident-notices.ts`).
//!
//! `prime-agent incident` (the classifier in `pa_types::incident`, the TS
//! `src/cli/incident.ts` port) already reconstructs daemon incidents from
//! the shared structured log (`~/.prime/agent/logs/agent.jsonl`); this
//! module reuses that classifier — never re-implementing it — to surface
//! a single collapsed, dismissible notice line in the agents-view header.
//! A notice appears when the recent window of the log contains a worker
//! crash, a command-timeout burst, or an update restart (a supervisor
//! replacement), so the operator sees the incident without running the
//! CLI by hand. On the initial read the view matches the CLI's
//! `[agent.jsonl.old, agent.jsonl]` source with the same bounded tail, so
//! incidents spanning a log rotation surface too.
