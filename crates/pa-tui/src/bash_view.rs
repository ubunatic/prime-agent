//! The dedicated bash view (the operator's 2026-09-23 redesign, refined
//! 2026-09-24): the session's kernel bash registry — the background
//! commands the agent's REPL started — as a columned table (command,
//! duration, pid, status) whose columns hug their content (the columns
//! never stretch to the terminal edge) while the table surface fills
//! the full width (the selected row's wash spans the terminal, the
//! operator's 2026-09-24 ruling), and Enter on a row opens the detail

//! started, duration, status), the exact command, and the fetched output
//! tail in a scrollable region — up/down walk the output, and reaching
//! the top of the loaded window lazily loads more of the tail (the
//! window starts at [`FIRST_TAIL_LINES`] and doubles on each load up to
//! the 200-line wire cap). The status colors code the rows (running
