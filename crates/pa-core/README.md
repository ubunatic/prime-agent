# pa-core

The session engine.

## Scope
MCP host side (`mcp/`): auth gating for built-in integrations (the
disabled-skill overrides and `/mcp list` status), the `mcpServers` settings
seam, and the `mcp.*` host-request handlers the kernel's generic MCP
client reaches through (`mcp.config`, `mcp.refresh`, optional
`mcp.begin_login`). The OAuth flow lives behind it (`oauth*` submodules:
RFC 9728 discovery, dynamic registration, PKCE, the local callback
server, token refresh; `login.rs`: login execution that persists the
endpoint-bound credential into the shared auth store and the
`wire_begin_login`/`McpOAuth` refresh integration hosts wire). The MCP
protocol itself runs kernel-side (Python
stdio/HTTP); the engine never spawns MCP servers. Tools (bash, edit, ipython + internal rename/stdout), file mutation queue, truncation and rendering rules, RLM kernel lifecycle (IPython spawn/execute/revive), skills loading, system prompt assembly, compaction, harness refinement, settings/config, package manager (npm/git/local source install/remove/list/update against settings), session manager (persist/resume). Autonomous mode
(`autonomous`): runtime state with limit normalization, continuation and
gate-failure texts, shell quality gates with retry windows and git
worktree snapshotting, and the `AutonomousDriver` policy trait a turn
loop consults after every settled turn (the engine holds no autonomous
logic of its own). The RLM recursion host seam
(`session_engine::rlm_host`): the trait the kernel's `rlm.spawn`/
`rlm.create_session`/`rlm.list_subagents`/`rlm.collect`/
`rlm.delete_subagent` host requests call into, with the roster/collect/
selector-error vocabulary the daemon implements over the supervisor link.
Platform wall (`platform`): process control (signals/process groups), file locking, file permissions, and shell selection - every OS-specific behavior in the engine lives there behind cfg-gated implementations (the durable-write rename primitive is pa-telemetry's `rename_onto`, re-exported as `platform::rename_onto`). Scheduled jobs (`cron`, the `AgentCronJobStore` port of `core/cron-jobs.ts`): file-backed job state under session artifacts (`scheduled-jobs.json` partitions) with cross-process locking, plus the public read-only scan (`cron::store::read_scheduled_jobs_artifact`) the update flow's roster projection and boot re-arm read. Tools (bash, edit, ipython + internal rename/stdout), file mutation queue, truncation and rendering rules, RLM kernel lifecycle (IPython spawn/execute/revive), skills loading, system prompt assembly, compaction, harness refinement, settings/config, package manager (npm/git/local source install/remove/list/update against settings, plus `resolve()`: precedence-ranked session resource resolution over configured packages, settings arrays, auto-discovery, and bundled skills), session manager (persist/resume). origin/main

Provider resilience policies in `session_engine`: the shared quick-retry
policy (TS `provider-retry.ts`: permanent-kind classification,
Retry-After-aware capped delays), the interactive auto-retry loop, and the
provider-failover driver (when a provider exhausts its quick retries and
another configured provider serves the same model, the failed turn
re-routes to the next provider in catalog order; the TS
`auto_retry_start`/`reason: "backup"` event vocabulary surfaces the
progression). The drivers are pure decision logic: the host (pa-daemon)
owns the attempt, the wait, and the model switch.

Session HTML export (`export_html`): the standalone viewer file for
`/export` and `session export` - the embedded product template
(assets/export-html, vendored marked/highlight.js attributed in its
NOTICE.md) plus the theme-to-CSS resolution over the bundled theme data
(pa-types) and custom themes under `<agent-dir>/themes/`, the tools
section mapping (`tools_section`: the session's tool registry to the
template's name/description/parameters list), and the custom-tool
pre-render pipeline (`ToolHtmlRenderer`/`pre_render_custom_tools` +
`ansi_to_html`: the exporter walks the entries, the session layer's
renderer produces line-oriented output, ANSI converts to inline-styled
HTML at the export step), and the two entry points
(`export_session_to_html` for the daemon worker's `export_html`
command, `export_from_file` for the CLI). Terminal theme rendering stays
pa-tui's; tool renderers live with the session's tool surface;
the share-viewer flow (gist creation) is the caller's.
Cloud workspace snapshots (`workspace_snapshot`): the portable, verifiable
capture of a git worktree's working state - tracked modifications, staged
paths, deletions, and nonignored untracked files - staged into an
owner-private directory as content-addressed blobs plus a deterministic
manifest that hashes them, with credential-shaped, symlink-ancestor,
escaping-symlink, nested-repo, and submodule exclusions recorded in the
manifest, hard entry/size bounds, race-free openat(O_NOFOLLOW) leaf reads
(Unix), and offline verification of a staged snapshot before upload. Capture
refuses on non-Unix targets: owner-only 0700 staging and 0600 files cannot be
enforced there. The baseline is an explicit caller choice (`BaselineMode`):
HEAD's tree content staged through the same filters as the delta (each entry
verified against HEAD's recorded object id and mode, no git history ships),
or an explicit external reference the consumer must reach itself. The secret
skip is a filename-shaped denylist only; ordinary-named files containing
secrets stage verbatim. Snapshot directories are secret-bearing: every
consumer must treat them as credentials. Capture does synchronous file I/O
inside its async entry point; callers must offload the entire operation with
`tokio::task::spawn_blocking` and `Handle::block_on`. Foundation plumbing
only: nothing wires it to a user-facing cloud toggle yet.

## Non-goals
No provider HTTP (pa-ai), no loop policy (pa-agent), no daemon supervision (pa-daemon), no TUI (pa-tui). No update coordination (the pa-cli coordinator owns the FSM; the update-flow seam here is the daemon-free support layer: `update::version` (semver/channel policy), `update::install` (the managed install-root layout), `update::release` (the channel manifest fetch), `update::download` (sha256-verified archive download + staging)). The package manager installs sources and resolves resource paths only. No workspace snapshot upload, transport, or remote materialization (staging and verification live here; the cloud attach surface owns the transport when it ships).

## Public API
`SessionEngine` (message in -> events out), `export_html` (the HTML exporter plus its renderer seam: `tools_section`, `pre_render_custom_tools` + `ToolHtmlRenderer`/`RenderedToolHtml`/`RenderedToolResult`, and `ansi_to_html::ansi_lines_to_html`/`tool_render::trim_rendered_result_lines` for renderer implementers), `ToolRegistry`, kernel manager, settings (`SettingsManager`), packages (`packages::PackageManager` + source types), `platform` (process control, file locking, permissions, shell selection - usable by higher crates, e.g. pa-cli's detached spawn), `session_engine::rlm_host::RlmSubagentHost` (implemented by pa-daemon for supervisor-backed children; the default is no children), `mcp::McpManager` (the session's host-side MCP manager, exposed as `SessionEngine.mcp_manager`: auth gating for built-in integrations, the `mcpServers` setting seam, and the `mcp.*` host-request handlers - `mcp.config`/`mcp.refresh`/optional `mcp.begin_login` - the kernel's generic MCP client resolves through), `mcp::McpManager::connection_roster` + `mcp::McpConnectionEntry` (the `/mcp` view's roster: every resolved integration with its connected state, display kind, transport, and generic-listable flag), `mcp::McpManager::service_catalog_views` + `service_catalog_diagnostics` (the `/mcp` view's resolved service-catalog cards and their diagnostics, answered from local state - the TS `buildServiceCatalogViews` parity; the picker never round-trips the kernel), `mcp::McpManager::api_key_credential_views` + `mcp::API_KEY_CREDENTIALS`/`McpCredentialView` (the `/mcp` view's api-key credential rows - the stored keys the surface manages alongside the connections, e.g. the web-search key - configured from the shared auth store), `models` (the registry and resolver, plus `models::order_for_picker`: the picker-catalog order the composition root applies to its snapshot), `session_engine::provider_adapter` (`switchable_stream_fn`/`ProviderTarget`: the live provider-target slot a host swaps on `set_model`; the adapter bridges the loop's abort into pa-ai's `StreamOptions::signal` cancellation token, so a turn abort cancels the in-flight HTTP fetch at the transport — closed by `ModelStream::close` and the stream's drop), `session_engine::ipython_state` (the post-compaction `ipython_state` kernel-persistence notice: the `CompactionKernelProbe` view of the kernel provisioner the engine wiring binds via `AgentSession::set_kernel_state_probe`, and the notice row that rides `CompactRun` for the surfaces to broadcast). `session_engine::session_commands` (the `/compact`/`/refine`/`/goal`/`/autonomous` executor: the durable echo/result rows with their persistence order - the echo ahead of the command so its own work sees it - the compaction/refinement/goal/autonomous arms, and the post-execution live-context rebuild that keeps the rows in the agent state; hosts own the wire surface), `session_engine::auto_refine_trigger` (the compact-trigger auto-refine machine on `AgentSession`: the arm/discard/increment accessors and `consume_compact_auto_refine`, the shared gate/review/stamp sequence every scheduling surface applies - TS `_compactAutoRefinePending`/`_lastAutoRefineReviewAt`/`_assistantTurnsSinceAutoRefine` plus `_maybeAutoRefine`'s compact arm, the serialized checkpoint's compact step, and dispose's serialized drain, with the surface parameter carrying the one behavioral difference between a boundary and a disposal). `session_engine::goal_boundary` (the goal arms of the natural turn end on `SessionEngine`: the `--goal` construction seed with its next-turn context row - TS `_pendingNextTurnMessages` on `AgentSession` - the usage accounting, the budget-limit steer mint, the natural continuation mint with its slot rollback, and the terminal-error finish; the transports - the print driver's in-loop hook, the ACP settle loop, the daemon worker's queue - drive the one goal driver through these methods). `SessionEngine::expand_skill_submission` + `AgentSession`'s prompt-path expansion (the `/skill:<name>` submission seam, TS `_expandSkillCommand`: `skills::expand_skill_command` builds the `<skill ...>` block over the shared `pa_types::skill_blocks` parse, the accepted-turn row and the admitted user message agree on the expanded text, and the `skill used` adoption event reports from the admission). `workspace_snapshot` (`create_workspace_snapshot`: bounded, secret/nested-repo/submodule/symlink-ancestor-excluding capture of a git worktree into an owner-private staging directory, with the caller-chosen `BaselineMode` (HEAD-tree content verified against HEAD's object ids, or explicit external) and a `ConcurrentMutation` error when the worktree changes under the capture; `verify_workspace_snapshot`: offline manifest/blob/baseline integrity check; the `SnapshotManifest`/`WorkspaceSnapshot`/`SnapshotLimits`/`BaselineMode`/`SnapshotError` types). All subsystem internals `pub(crate)`; the engine is the only facade - subsystems must not import each other directly (the package manager consumes the public settings API only).

## Depends on
pa-types, pa-ai, pa-agent (one-way).
