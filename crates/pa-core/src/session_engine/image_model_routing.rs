//! The image-model routing host seam (TS agent-session's settingsManager +

//! Turn dispatch consults this seam when the delivered batch attaches image

//! `None` on the session keeps today's behavior (image turns serve on the
//! session model): verification harnesses, and the daemon worker, whose
