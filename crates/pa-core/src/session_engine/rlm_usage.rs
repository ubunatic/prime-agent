//! RLM child-usage attribution: the producer that folds a recursive
//! child's billable usage into the parent assistant row that spawned it.
//!
//! TS `agent-session.ts`: `attributeChildUsage` (the child's fields and
//! cost fold into the parent row while `totalTokens` stays the parent's
//! model-facing context — recursive children launch from an assistant
//! tool call, so their tokens affect billable totals, not the parent
//! turn's context), the per-run `pendingChildUsage` origin buckets, and
//! `flushPendingChildUsageAttribution` (one durable `child_usage_attributed`
//! row per origin batch through `SessionManager.appendChildUsageAttribution`,
//! with the failure swallowed as recoverable bookkeeping).
//!
//! Observation split: TS children run in-process, so the
//! parent subscribes to child events and folds live at every child
//! `message_end`. Rust children are separate worker processes; the
//! daemon's children registry (`pa-daemon/rlm_children.rs`) observes
//! child turn boundaries and delivers per-origin usage batches here.
//! The flush folds the batch into the target assistant row in the
//! session manager and appends the durable row in one event — the
//! daemon's stats read the file, so there is no separate live-message
//! fold to keep in step (TS updates the live message object because its
//! own stats surfaces read it; the durable row is the same source of
//! truth in both).
