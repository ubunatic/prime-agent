//! The session engine's goal boundary arms (TS `agent-session.ts`'s goal
//! hooks), shared by the headless drivers: the natural-turn-end mint, the
//! budget-limit wrap-up steer, the usage accounting, and the terminal-error
//! finish. The TS session installs these on the agent's continuation hook
//! and its message-end/agent-end handlers; the Rust engines expose them as
//! engine methods so each transport (the print driver's in-loop hook, the
//! ACP settle loop, the daemon worker's queue) drives the same one state
//! machine — the goal driver and the persistence handle are the single
//! representation.
//!
//! Surfaces, per the TS site each method ports:
//! - `seed_initial_goal`: the CLI `--goal` construction-time seed (depth-0
//!   branch seeding, the context row riding the next turn).
//! - `record_goal_usage`: `_accountGoalUsageForAssistantMessage` at
//!   `message_end` — settled non-error, non-aborted turns spend the budget;
//!   the crossing flips the goal to `budget_limited`.
//! - `goal_budget_limit_steer`: `_shouldStopAfterTurn`'s budget arm — the
//!   wrap-up context the crossing turn queues as its steer.
//! - `mint_goal_continuation`: `_getGoalContinuationMessages` — an active
//!   goal mints one continuation context per natural turn end.
//! - `rollback_goal_continuation_mint`: the cancelled-threshold-queue and
//!   input-arrival rollbacks (the slot returns for the next boundary).
//! - `fail_goal_for_terminal_error`: `_finishGoalForTerminalAssistantMessage`
//!   — a failed run fails an active goal; an abort keeps it.
