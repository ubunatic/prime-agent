//! Compaction phase tracing (debug seam, off by default): one line per
//! phase boundary of the compaction pipeline, so a post-summary stall
//! (the compacted text rendered but the compaction indicator keeps
//! spinning) can be attributed to the phase that owns the extra time.
//!
//! `PA_COMPACTION_TRACE=1` (or `stderr`) writes stderr;
//! `PA_COMPACTION_TRACE=<path>` appends one JSON line per boundary. The
//! path must be a regular file (or creatable as one): the sink opens it
//! once, synchronously, at the first trace line — a FIFO would block that
//! first line until a reader appears. The first trace line of the
//! process also starts the elapsed clock, so `elapsedMicros` on every
//! line reads as time since the run began.
