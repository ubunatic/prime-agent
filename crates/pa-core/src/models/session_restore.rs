//! Session-model restore with a bounded catalog-readiness wait.
//!
//! Port of `findSessionModelWithReadinessWait` (model-resolver.ts): a
//! revived session's saved model can be missing from the registry only
//! because the daemon boot's catalog/auth refresh has not settled yet,
//! so the lookup gives the in-flight refreshes a bounded window before
//! it is allowed to fail. Without the wait a revived session races the
//! catalog fetch and silently lands on the startup-chain default
//! (the featured model) instead of the model it was running on.
