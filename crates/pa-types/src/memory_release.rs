//! Returning freed heap to the OS after large transient phases.
//!
//! Session loads and attach snapshots allocate several transient copies of
//! the session body (parsed entry trees, wire JSON, replay contexts) that
//! are dropped right after the phase ends. glibc keeps freed chunks in its
//! arenas, so those phases' peaks stay resident in RSS forever. The helpers
//! here are pure allocator plumbing: no data, capability, or protocol
//! behavior changes, and they are no-ops wherever the platform has no
//! glibc seam (every non-glibc/Linux build).

/// Cap glibc's per-thread arenas.
///
/// The default arena limit (`8 * ncores`) lets a burst of allocation from
/// tokio worker and blocking-pool threads grow one arena per thread; every
/// arena keeps its high-water pages. A moderate cap leaves the parallel
/// workers their arenas (a hard cap showed up as allocation contention in
/// the 16-way parallel e2e suite) while collapsing the default's arena
/// sprawl.
