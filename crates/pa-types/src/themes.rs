//! JSON content is the product theme file, verbatim; a theme's `export`
//! section carries the export page's background overrides.
//!
//! Only the built-in themes are data here; discovery of custom theme files
//! (`<agent-dir>/themes/<name>.json`) and every behavior built on top of
//! these files belong to the consuming crates.
